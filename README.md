# Comparing Sorting Algorithms

This project's code provide a way to compare the performance of the following sorting algorithms:
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

Initially, an array of one million random integers ranging from 1 to 3,000,000.

Then copies of different sizes from the original array are made to test the performance of each sorting algorithm.
